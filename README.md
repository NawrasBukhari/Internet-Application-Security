# instructions for all labortories installation

1- You have to install a server such as xampp or wamp but I prefer wamp because it supports many PHP versions. </br>
2- You have to install it as a zip file then extract it to the "www" in (wamp) or "htdocs" in "xampp". </br>
3- Make sure to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed and [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) you can find them by clicking on them. </br>
4- Use PHPStorm or VS-Code for easier code editing. </br>
5- Run the following codes in the terminal but make sure that your terminal in the right project directory

```bash
composer install
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
